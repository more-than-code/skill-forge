description: File machine-detected findings into the Defect Drainer inventory as defects with evidence, and run the human adjudication loop over them. Covers the /api/intake contract (multipart fields, normalize modes, the async 202), bridge discipline for an automated detector (idempotency, unmodified evidence, filing without pre-filtering), and what an operator does with a queue of findings. Use when wiring a parity harness, vision review, a11y scan, lint sweep, or any other detector into Defect Drainer; when findings need a human decision before anyone writes code; or when a script posted to intake and you need to know whether anything was actually created.

# Defect Drainer intake

Getting machine-detected findings into a durable inventory where a **human decides what
they are**, and getting that decision back out as something a machine can check next time.

## Scope — read this before adding anything here

Defect Drainer's own repo documents the workflow it owns: report → inventory → batch fix →
prove → PR → resolve (`defect-drainer/docs/workflow.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `_template.md`). That
is discoverable from the repo and changes with the product. **Do not restate it here.**

This skill covers only the seam neither repo documents: how an automated detector's output
becomes a human queue, and what the human does with it. If something you want to add is
true of DD generally, it belongs in DD's docs.

## 1. The intake contract

`POST /api/intake` — multipart, accepts multiple files per report.

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `comment` | free text. **Also the source of the title** — see §2 |
| `severity` | `P1` / `P2` / `P3` |
| `area`, `surface`, `source` | triage facets; `source` is how you find your own batch later |
| `app_id` | defects are per app; an app may own several repos |
| `repos` | comma-separated; the coding agent picks where to fix |
| `mode` | `local` / `grok` / `manual` — see below |
| files | posted unmodified, in order (`01.png`, `02.png`, …) |

`client` is **derived from the app** and should normally be left unset — operators select an
app, not a platform. Defect statuses are `open`, `triaged`, `in_progress`, `resolved`,
`wontfix`, `duplicate`.

### `mode` — the trap

| Mode | What it does |
|---|---|
| `local` | deterministic normalisation on the host. The right default for detector output. |
| `grok` | a vision agent reads the screenshots and writes the defect body. |
| `manual` | **parks the job at `waiting_external`** and waits for something outside DD to `POST /api/jobs/:id/complete`. |

`manual` does not mean "a human will look at it later." It means *"an external agent will
finish this job."* Observed 2026-08-16: 25 findings posted with `mode: manual` produced 25
jobs at `waiting_external` and **zero defects**. Every request returned `202`.

Do not send `grok` for text that is already LLM output. A vision pass over a vision
reviewer's own summary adds a second lossy hop and launders the first pass's errors into
confident prose.

### A 202 is not a filing

Intake is asynchronous: the route enqueues a job and returns `202 {job}`. The defect does
not exist yet, and may never. **Read back before claiming anything was filed:**

```bash
curl -s localhost:8788/api/defects | jq '[.defects[] | select(.source=="parity-review")] | length'
curl -s localhost:8788/api/jobs | jq -r '.jobs[] | "\(.status) \(.mode) \(.defectId)"' | sort | uniq -c
```

A `waiting_external` or `failed` count above zero is the failure this whole section exists
to catch. The health endpoint's `open`/`resolved` counters are the fastest sanity check.

## 2. Writing the report

**Set the title deliberately.** In `local` mode the title is the first 72 characters of
`comment` (`normalizeJob.ts`), and multipart transport rewrites `\n` as `\r\n`. A comment
that opens with a prefix line therefore yields titles like:

```
[parity-review] discover-list — copy-mismatch\r\n\r\nEnded challenge and …
```

Twenty-five of those make a list view nobody can triage from. Lead the comment with one
self-contained sentence that reads as a title on its own, and put the machinery below it.

**Say what the finding is NOT.** A detector with recall has poor precision — that is the
trade that makes it useful. The report must carry the caveat, because the operator reading
it three days later has no other way to know:

- which detector produced it, which backend/model, and when;
- how to verify it against source (a semantics dump, a route file — something specific);
- that it is **not adjudicated**;
- its baseline state, stated as text and *not acted on*.

**Evidence goes in unmodified.** Post both halves of a comparison as separate files, never
composited into one side-by-side image. A finding is unreadable without both at full
resolution, and a compositing step's bugs are indistinguishable from product bugs in the
result.

## 3. Bridge discipline

A bridge script moves findings; it does not judge them.

1. **File everything.** No quality filter, no confidence threshold, no dropping findings
   that look wrong. If the bridge decides what is worth a human's time, the human is no
   longer in the loop — they are reviewing the bridge's opinion. Map severity mechanically
   and carry the detector's own rating through verbatim so a bad mapping stays visible.
2. **Baseline state is reported, never enforced.** Already-accepted debt may still be worth
   inventorying; that is the operator's call.
3. **Idempotency on the detector's own key.** Use the same key the detector's ratchet or
   baseline uses — re-running after a re-detection must not duplicate. Keep a ledger file of
   what was sent.
4. **Claim the key in-loop, not just against the ledger.** A detector can emit two findings
   sharing one key at different severities. Consulting a ledger you only write at the end
   files both and records one, so the next run duplicates. Add the key to an in-memory set
   the moment you decide to send it.
5. **Ledger records what was SENT.** Intake is async, so there is no defect id to record
   synchronously. Do not write a ledger entry that implies more certainty than you have.
6. **Dry-run before the first real batch.** `--dry-run` printing the keys catches
   duplicate-key and missing-evidence bugs while they are free.

## 4. The adjudication loop

This is the point of the inventory. Everything above exists to make this step possible.

**Batch size is a correctness property.** Twenty-five findings handed over at once is a
rubber stamp with extra steps; the operator scrolls, the marginal call gets the same
attention as the obvious one, and a wrong accept becomes permanent baseline. Adjudicate in
the same unit the detector works in — one screen, one lens, one category at a time.

Every finding has exactly three outcomes, and each one has an artifact:

| Outcome | Artifact |
|---|---|
| **Real defect** | keep it open in DD, triaged with the repo that owns it |
| **False positive** | `wontfix` with the reason, *and* the detector's baseline updated so it stops re-reporting |
| **Accepted debt** | baseline entry with reason + date + owner, and a real task if it will be fixed |

Closing a false positive without updating the detector's baseline guarantees you adjudicate
it again next run. That is how an inventory becomes noise and gets abandoned.

### The arrow back — how autonomy is earned

**An adjudication you have made twice is a deterministic check you have not written yet.**

This is the only mechanism that shrinks the human queue without lowering the bar. A vision
reviewer reporting "the composer is misaligned" is a judgement call every single run; a
geometry check asserting two declared regions share a vertical centre is a fact, and it
never needs a human again. The first was adjudicated by eye repeatedly before it became the
second.

So when you adjudicate, ask what would have caught this without you. If the answer is a
comparison of two numbers, a presence assertion, or a schema check — that is the next thing
to build, and it retires a recurring line item from the queue permanently.

A detector graduates to running unattended **one check at a time**, when that specific check
has been right repeatedly with no false positive. Never by deciding the detector as a whole
is now trustworthy.

  across look, geometry, tokens, copy, interaction and API. Its visual review is the only
  check in it with recall, and therefore the one whose output needs this queue.
