# Grok Build Harness

Delegating a substantial build to the local **Grok Build** CLI (`grok`). Grok is a
capable agentic coder with image and video generation the host agent may lack — but
headless runs fail in specific, repeatable ways. This skill is that harness.

**Hard rule:** verify artifacts, never the model's claim of doneness. A run can
exit 0 having produced less than it narrates.

**Second hard rule: probe the version, don't read about it.** Grok moves fast and
its own shipped `~/.grok/README.md` lags the binary — as of 1.0.41 that README still
documents `"stopReason":"EndTurn"` and a sandbox that fails *open*, and the wire
disagrees with both. The changelog is not the inventory either: 1.0.41's announces a
`sports_search` tool that the session's own `available_commands` does not list. Every
observation below is dated and stamped with the version it was taken on. Re-probe
anything load-bearing.

This skill is the **transport** layer: how to spawn, observe, and resume `grok`. For the
surrounding method — when to hand a task to an external worker at all, how to brief it per
phase, and how to accept what comes back — activate `external-worker-delegation`.

## Preflight (always)

```bash
grok --version            # observations below are stamped 1.0.40-1.0.46; latest re-probe 1.0.46 (2026-10-03)
grok models               # confirms login + available models
grok inspect              # skills, agents, hooks, permissions, sandbox for THIS directory
```

`grok models` failing or printing a login prompt means the delegation cannot run —
the user must `grok login` themselves.

`grok inspect` is the one to actually read before writing a brief: it prints which
instruction files, skills, agents and hooks Grok will load *in that directory*, which
of them are disabled, and its harness-compatibility switches. A worker inheriting a
skill you did not expect, or missing one you did, is visible here and nowhere else.

**Record the version alongside any observation about the wire format.** The event
schema, the `stopReason` vocabulary and the turn semantics have all changed across
majors; a claim about what `grok` emits means nothing without the version that
emitted it.

## Observing the run — always use a streaming format

Plain `-p` prints only the model's prose, **at exit**. It is not a progress signal and
it hides why the run stopped. Headless supports four formats (1.0.41):

| Format | Emits | Use |
|--------|-------|-----|
| `plain` (default) | prose at exit | never, for delegation |
| `json` | one object at exit | scripted single-shot calls; pairs with `--json-schema` |
| `streaming-json` | NDJSON, one **ACP session update** per line — Grok's native format | **delegation** |
| `streaming-messages-json` | NDJSON in the Anthropic Messages API wire format | reusing an Anthropic-shaped parser you already own |

```bash
grok -p "…" --output-format streaming-json | tee run.jsonl
```

`--include-partial-messages` adds incremental text/thinking deltas, and affects
`streaming-messages-json` only.

**`streaming-json` *is* the ACP event stream.** The two transports have converged:
what the help calls "the agent's native format" is the same session-update vocabulary
`grok agent stdio` pushes. Tool visibility is therefore in headless mode, and the
guidance that it was ACP-only is obsolete.

Directly observed on 1.0.40, 1.0.41 and 1.0.46: `text`, `thought`, `tool_call`, `tool_call_update`,
`usage`, `available_commands`, `end`, and `max_turns_reached` (under `--max-turns`).
Carried over from earlier versions but not seen in these probes: `error`,
`auto_compact_*`. The list is **not exhaustive** and it grows between versions, so
switch on `type` and ignore unknowns.

`tool_call` carries `toolCallId`, `toolName`, `kind`, `title`, `status` and `rawInput`;
`tool_call_update` carries the result, and for a write it includes a real diff
(`{type:"diff", path, oldText, newText}`) plus `locations`. That is genuine write
visibility — but it reports what Grok *attempted*, so for deliverables still check
the filesystem:

```bash
find work/src work/static -type f -newer work/BRIEF.md | sort
```

`available_commands` enumerates the live tool and slash-command inventory for the
session. Read it instead of assuming which tools exist in the version you are driving.

The `end` event is the run's post-mortem, verified shape on 1.0.40 and unchanged on 1.0.41 and 1.0.46:

```json
{"type":"end","stopReason":"end_turn","sessionId":"…","requestId":"…",
 "usage":{…},"num_turns":11,"total_cost_usd":0.089947,
 "total_cost_usd_ticks":899470000,"modelUsage":{…}}
```

Read four fields every time:

- **`stopReason`** — why it stopped, and now **snake_case** (`end_turn`, `cancelled`).
  A driver loop grepping for the old `EndTurn` matches nothing and loops forever.
- **`num_turns`** — how much it actually did.
- **`total_cost_usd`** — accumulate across iterations. `total_cost_usd_ticks` is the
  same figure as an integer, USD x 10^10.
- **`sessionId`** — keep it. It is the key to `grok usage` (see Cost below) and to
  `grok -r <id>`.

**`modelUsage` is keyed by the id the server reports, not the one you asked for.** On
1.0.46 (2026-10-03) every run's row was `grok-4.7-build`, even with `-m grok-4.7`, and that
id is in neither `grok models` nor the model cache. The documented per-model `contextWindow`
appears only on a row that matches a known model, so it was absent. Do not read the context
window from the `end` event (see Context window).

## Gotcha 1 — turn exhaustion, not single-turn (changed in 1.0)

**On 1.0.x, `-p` runs the task to completion.** Verified on 1.0.40 (2026-09-22) and
again on 1.0.41 (2026-09-24): a six-step brief with read-then-write dependencies between
steps, given in one `--prompt-file`, ran every step in **11 turns** and exited 0 with
`stopReason: "end_turn"` and correct file contents.

The old trap is gone. On **0.2.x**, `-p` ran exactly one assistant turn: the model did
a batch of tool calls, ended its response intending to continue, and the process exited
0 mid-plan with a truncated narration ("Scaffolding next…"). That failure mode cost
hours of misdiagnosis and is what the driver loop below existed to work around. If you
are on a 0.2.x build, it still applies — and the fix is to upgrade, not to loop.

**What still stops a run early is the turn cap**, and it is cheap to identify because
the signals are unambiguous (verified on 1.0.40, 1.0.41 and 1.0.46 with `--max-turns 2`;
on 1.0.46 a three-file task stopped after two files, with the third never created):

| Exit | `stopReason` | Extra event | Meaning |
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| 0 | `end_turn` | — | Ran to completion. Check artifacts anyway. |
| 1 | `cancelled` | `max_turns_reached` | Hit `--max-turns`. Resume it. |
| 0 | `cancelled` | none; the `tool_call_update` is `failed` with "User cancelled the execution" | A tool call was cancelled and nothing ran. Seen on 1.0.46 when `--permission-mode default` was passed beside `--always-approve`. |
| non-zero | absent / `error` | `error` | Genuine failure. Read it; do not resume blindly. |

So: a **non-zero exit plus `max_turns_reached`** is the resume signal, and `end_turn`
with deliverables missing is a real model stop worth reading the narration for. The
exit-0 `cancelled` row is the dangerous one: it looks like success, did no work, and
resuming it just repeats the cancellation. Do not
raise `--max-turns` reflexively; an unfinished brief at a high cap usually means the
brief was too big for one session, not that the cap was too low.

**Driver loop — only for turn exhaustion, and still artifact-gated:**

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 30); do
  grok -c -p "Continue executing BRIEF.md, resuming where you left off. \
Do not stop early; every deliverable must exist and be verified." \
    --sandbox workspace --always-approve --max-turns 400 \
    --output-format streaming-json | tee -a run.jsonl
  [ -f NOTES.md ] && ls dist/*.out >/dev/null 2>&1 && break   # real completion markers
done
```

Rules for the loop:
- Test **artifacts on disk**, never the model's claim of doneness.
- `grok -c` resumes the most recent session *for that cwd*, so context carries over;
  `grok -r <sessionId>` resumes a specific one, and `--fork-session` branches instead
  of reusing the id.
- Break on a genuine error. Note that a `max_turns_reached` run also exits non-zero,
  so a loop that breaks on *any* non-zero exit will not resume — distinguish the two
  by `stopReason` rather than by exit code alone.
- One resumed iteration commonly runs 15–25 min and does enormous work. Budget for it.

## Gotcha 2 — the sandbox write boundary, and how to widen it

Five built-in profiles on 1.0.40, 1.0.41 and 1.0.46 (probed by name). Take write sets from the
bundled `~/.grok/docs/user-guide/18-sandbox.md`, not the shipped `~/.grok/README.md`:
on 1.0.41 the README omits `devbox`, lists older write sets, and says `~/.ssh`,
`~/.aws`, `~/.gnupg` are "always write-protected regardless of profile", which probing
disproves (below).

| Profile | FS read | FS write | Child network | `~/.ssh` `~/.aws` `~/.gnupg` | Use |
|---------|---------|----------|---------------|------------------------------|-----|
| `off` (default) | everywhere | everywhere | allowed | **writable** | no sandbox |
| `workspace` | everywhere | CWD + temp + `~/.grok` | allowed | blocked only while outside CWD | default; recommended |
| `read-only` | everywhere | temp + `~/.grok` | blocked (Linux only) | blocked (no CWD grant) | exploration/review |
| `strict` | CWD + system paths + `~/.grok` | CWD + temp + `~/.grok/sessions` | blocked (Linux only) | blocked only while outside CWD | untrusted code |
| `devbox` | everywhere | every top-level dir except `/data` | allowed | **writable** | disposable VMs only |

"Temp" is `/tmp`, `/var/tmp` and the macOS temp dirs. Child-network blocking is
seccomp, so on macOS `read-only` and `strict` do not restrict it.

Re-probed on 1.0.46 (2026-10-03) on macOS, from a scratch CWD under `$HOME` (not `$HOME`
itself), by asking each profile to create and remove a file in each place. Every row of
the table held:

| Profile | `~/.ssh` `~/.aws` | `~/.grok` | other `$HOME` file | CWD | temp | outbound HTTPS |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|--------------------|-----|------|----------------|
| `off` | writable | writable | writable | writable | writable | ok |
| `workspace` | blocked | writable | blocked | writable | writable | ok |
| `read-only` | blocked | writable | blocked | blocked | writable | ok |
| `strict` | blocked | blocked | blocked | writable | writable | ok |
| `devbox` | writable | writable | writable | writable | writable | ok |

`~/.gnupg` did not exist on the probe host, so it was not tested.

**No profile protects credential paths by name.** `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws` and `~/.gnupg`
are unwritable only when they fall outside the profile's write set. Probed on 1.0.41
(2026-09-26), and re-confirmed on 1.0.46 for everything but the `$HOME`-as-CWD case,
with a create-then-remove file: all three were writable under `off` and
`devbox`. Under `workspace` and `strict` they were blocked from a scratch CWD, but
writable when CWD was `$HOME`. Under `read-only`, which grants no CWD write, they were
blocked. A `read_write` grant that covers them would open them under any profile.
Grok's own credentials (`~/.grok/auth.json`) sit inside the `~/.grok` write grant, so
they stayed writable under `workspace` and `read-only`. Only `strict`, which narrows
that grant to `~/.grok/sessions`, blocked them, and only while CWD was elsewhere.
What Grok does write-deny is its config, trust, sandbox
and hook files (`config.toml`, `sandbox.toml`, `hooks/`, ...), and only under
`workspace`, `read-only` and `strict`, not `devbox`. To guarantee a credential path is
off-limits, list it under `deny` in a custom profile (below). That also blocks reads.

The sandbox is applied to the whole process at startup and is **irreversible**. The
model cannot talk its way out of it at runtime.

**It fails closed, not open.** An unknown profile name, or one whose rules cannot be
resolved, prints a warning and *refuses to start*: "Refusing to start with its
protections missing." (The README's "logs a warning and continues without
enforcement" is stale.) One live instance of this: `read-only` and `strict` both
carry a deny rule for the container runtime socket, and on a host where
`/var/run/docker.sock` is a **symlink**, resolution fails and neither profile will
start at all (reproduced on 1.0.41: both exit 1 with the refusal, as does an unknown
name, while `off`, `workspace` and `devbox` start). The warning names the cause as
"endpoint is a symlink", not a missing target. The reproducing host (2026-09-26) ran
Podman, and its symlink was a dangling leftover pointing at a nonexistent
`~/.docker/run/docker.sock`; no runtime used it. Removing that link was the whole
fix: both profiles then started and enforced as documented. So the trigger is the link
itself, whatever created it. Tools that install a Docker-compatible socket as a symlink
(for example `podman-mac-helper`) would plausibly trip it on a working setup too;
that case is unverified. Check with `ls -l /var/run/docker.sock`, and probe the
profile you intend to use before writing a brief around it. On 1.0.46 (2026-10-03) the
probe host had no `/var/run/docker.sock` at all and all five profiles started and
enforced, which fits the link being the trigger; the symlink case itself was not re-run
on 1.0.46.

**Custom profiles are the real fix for cache paths.** Define them in `~/.grok/sandbox.toml`
(global) or `.grok/sandbox.toml` (per project) and pass the name to `--sandbox`:

```toml
[profiles.build]
extends = "workspace"
read_write = ["/tmp/scratch"]   # literal directories, no globs
read_only  = ["/data"]
deny       = ["/data/secrets"]
restrict_network = true
```

A `read_write` grant for the toolchain's cache directory turns Gotcha 3's class of
failure from a workaround into a configuration line. Prefer it over `devbox`.

### What actually breaks in `workspace` (probed 2026-09-22, re-probed on 1.0.41 2026-09-24)

| Tool | Behaviour inside `workspace` | Verdict |
|------|------------------------------|---------|
| `pnpm install` | **Works.** Cannot write `~/Library/pnpm/store`, so pnpm 12.x silently relocates the store to a writable path and installs. Exit 0. Where it lands varies: `node_modules/.pnpm-store` in one probe, `/private/tmp/.pnpm-store` for a project under `/private/tmp` in another. | fine, but a cold store |
| `npm install` | **Fails** `EPERM` on `~/.npm` | blocked |
| direct write to `~/.npm` | `Operation not permitted`, exit 1 — under `--always-approve`, and on 1.0.46 also under `--permission-mode auto`. On 1.0.41 `auto` stopped the command before it ran (next section) | as designed |

**npm's error message is actively misleading.** On the cache EPERM it reports "Your
cache folder contains root-owned files, due to a bug in previous versions of npm" and
tells you to run `sudo chown -R … ~/.npm`. Nothing is root-owned and that command
fixes nothing — it is npm guessing at the only permission problem it knows about.
The real cause is the sandbox boundary. Do not run the `sudo` it suggests, and warn
the brief's reader off it too.

The older claim that **pnpm segfaults** here (`SecItemCopyMatching -50`, exit 139) was
real on the 0.2.x/1.0.13-era combination but **does not reproduce on 1.0.40 or 1.0.41
with pnpm 12.5.1**. Treat a signal death from a package manager as a version-specific symptom to
re-probe, not a standing fact.

**Fix — do the environment work yourself, outside the sandbox, before spawning:**

1. Scaffold the project and install dependencies (also avoids interactive creators,
   which hang or crash headless).
2. Pre-install any browser/binary the run needs. Reads work everywhere, so Grok can
   execute what you installed.
3. Or grant the cache path with a custom profile's `read_write`, which is better than
   redirecting caches per-spawn and better than dropping the sandbox.
4. Tell Grok in the brief that this is done and it must not re-scaffold.

### `--permission-mode auto` is a second gate, and a judgment call

The sandbox is not the only thing that can refuse an action. Under
`--permission-mode auto`, a model-judged classifier reviews each tool call first, and
**`--always-approve` does not override it.** Observed on 1.0.41 (2026-09-24): a brief
passed via `--prompt-file` explicitly asked for `touch ~/.npm/_probe`. The command never
ran, and the tool call failed with:

```text
Tool `run_terminal_command` was not executed: Auto mode blocked this action (… not
clearly requested in the visible user turn). … If no safer alternative exists, ask
the user how to proceed.
```

Three things make this a harness problem, not just a safety feature:

- **A headless run has no user to ask.** The model carries on without the step.
- **The run still ends `end_turn` with exit 0.** The refusal shows up only as a
  `tool_call_update` with `status: "failed"`, and in whatever the model chooses to put
  in `NOTES.md`.
- **A brief read from a file may not count as the user's request.** The classifier
  refused an action the brief spelled out word for word.

The same command under `--always-approve` without `auto` ran and hit the sandbox
(`Operation not permitted`, exit 1), which is the boundary a brief can reason about.
For delegation, make the sandbox the boundary and drop `auto`. If you keep it, check
every run for refusals:

```bash
jq -r 'select(.type=="tool_call_update" and .status=="failed")
       | .content[]?.content.text? // empty' run.jsonl | grep 'Auto mode blocked'
```

Not probed on 1.0.40, so this is not claimed to be new in 1.0.41. Only that it is
present there.

**Not reproduced on 1.0.46 (2026-10-03, one sample).** The same kind of brief
(`--prompt-file`, one `touch ~/.npm/<name>`, `--permission-mode auto --sandbox workspace
--always-approve`) ran the command, which then hit the sandbox: `Operation not permitted`,
`end_turn`, exit 0, no `Auto mode blocked` failure. The classifier is model-judged, so one
clean pass does not clear it. Keep the scan above, and keep the sandbox as the boundary.

## Gotcha 3 — headless Chromium under the sandbox

Playwright/Chromium has crashed under the sandbox (keychain `SecItemCopyMatching` /
crashpad), and its browser cache (`~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright` on macOS) is
outside the `workspace` writable set, so the download fails before the browser ever
runs. **Not re-probed on 1.0.40 or 1.0.41** — the package-manager half of this failure family
was fixed (Gotcha 2), so verify rather than assume before designing around it.

If it does crash, anything depending on headless capture — screenshots, HTML→PNG,
frame rendering for video — needs a fallback. Native rendering (e.g. Swift/AppKit on
macOS) works. State the fallback in the brief so Grok doesn't silently drop the
deliverable. The cheaper first move is a custom profile granting the browser cache
`read_write`, plus pre-installing the browser outside the sandbox.

## Gotcha 4 — native-toolchain builds may need a clean env

Rolldown/Vite-class native binaries can segfault under the agent's inherited
environment. Workaround Grok can use, and worth pre-authorizing in the brief:

```bash
env -i HOME="$HOME" PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/bin:/bin" pnpm build
```

Verify the build yourself afterwards in a normal shell — it usually passes there.

## Cost — `grok usage` outlives the run log

The `end` event carries `total_cost_usd` per run, but Grok also **persists usage per
session**, so the run log is not the only copy:

```bash
grok usage <sessionId>          # session totals + every recorded turn
grok usage <sessionId> <turn>   # one turn
```

It returns JSON: `inputTokens`, `outputTokens`, `cachedReadTokens`,
`reasoningTokens`, `modelCalls`, `turnCount`, `primaryModelId`, and `costUsdTicks`
(USD x 10^10 — `899470000` is $0.0899), nested under `session` for the totals and
`turns[]` per turn. Verified on 1.0.40, 1.0.41 and 1.0.46 against the same session's `end`
event; the cost figures agree to the tick.

**The two commands count different "turns".** `grok usage`'s `turnCount` and its
`[TURN]` argument count *prompts* — one per `-p` or `-c` invocation — while the `end`
event's `num_turns` counts model calls and matches `modelCalls`. The same 1.0.41 run
reported `num_turns: 11` and `turnCount: 1`. Handy for a driver loop: `grok usage <id> 3`
is the cost of the third iteration.

This matters for teardown: a worktree deleted with its `run.jsonl` inside has not
destroyed the cost record, provided you kept the `sessionId`. Keep it anyway — it is
also how you resume (`grok -r`) and export (`grok export`) that session.

## Context window — 256K by default, 500K on request

Probed on 1.0.46 (2026-10-03). The CLI keeps a model catalog, fetched from its own model
endpoint, in `~/.grok/models_cache.json`. For each of the four models listed there it records
`context_window: 256000`, `context_windows: [256000, 500000]` and
`auto_compact_threshold_percent: 80`. So a spawned `grok` defaults to **256,000 tokens**, and
500,000 is an option rather than the default. The bundled docs give the compaction default
as 85%; the catalog's 80% is what this install fetched, so treat it as the value in effect.
The window is not all usable: a one-word prompt already cost 22-28K input tokens (system
prompt plus tool definitions).

Read it, and change it, like this:

```bash
jq -r '.models | to_entries[] | "\(.key) \(.value.info.context_window) \(.value.info.context_windows)"' ~/.grok/models_cache.json
```

- **Per session, interactive:** `/context-window 500k`, or `/model <id> 500k`.
- **Persistently:** `[model."<id>"] context_window = 500000` in `~/.grok/config.toml`, which
  the docs list as a user setting and which inherits everything else from the built-in
  model. With it set, a fresh ACP `session/new` reported `totalContextTokens: 500000` for each
  model (`availableModels[]._meta`), and `256000` again once it was removed. It applies to every
  spawn that reads that config, so a custom profile or `HOME` that skips the file does not
  see it. The ACP metadata was the only place it showed: the headless `end` event carries no
  window (see Observing the run), so a `-p` run cannot confirm it.

**Why 256K is the default is not stated by the vendor.** Its model page (checked 2026-10-03)
gives the model's window as 500K, and its pricing page bills a request whose prompt reaches
200K tokens at twice the rate for every token in that request, input, cached and output alike.
A default that compacts near 200K stays under that tier; that is an inference, not a vendor
statement, and vendor pricing changes, so re-check before relying on it. For delegated
builds, keep the default and raise the window per session for a task that needs it.

## Imagine — image and video generation

All four tools are present on 1.0.40, 1.0.41 and 1.0.46 — `image_gen`, `image_edit`, `image_to_video`
and `reference_to_video` — confirmed in the session's own `available_commands` event
rather than from docs. Check that event for the version you are driving instead of
hedging. Instruct Grok to **load the bundled `imagine` skill before its first
generation**; note it is listed as `bundled:imagine` where a user skill has taken the
bare `/imagine` name.

**The split that decides output quality:**

| Needs | Use |
|-------|-----|
| Only the *look* — scenes, characters, textures, atmosphere | `image_gen` / `image_edit` |
| Exact text, data, structure — UI mockups, wordmarks, charts, share images with copy | **code** (HTML/CSS rendered, or SVG) |

Image models garble words, invent numbers, and break layout; a longer prompt does not
fix it and an edit pass rarely does.

**Consistency:** for a recurring character or object, generate/choose **one base image**
and `image_edit` every variation from it. Never `image_gen` the same subject twice.
If production art already exists in the repo, **reuse it** — it beats generation for
identity fidelity.

**Video:** starts from an image (no text-to-video). Plan as **short shots** (6s or 10s),
stage frame 1 with `image_gen`/`image_edit`, animate with `image_to_video`, one simple
camera move per shot. Lock **every** shot — generated and code-rendered — to one
resolution and frame rate so assembly is lossless:

```bash
ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i shots.txt -c copy out.mp4    # never re-encode
```

Expect transient **HTTP 429** on parallel generation calls; retry sequentially.

## Interactive delegation — `grok agent stdio` (ACP)

`-p` is fire-and-forget. For a back-channel, Grok also speaks **ACP** (Agent Client
Protocol) — JSON-RPC 2.0, newline-delimited, over stdio or WebSocket:

```bash
grok agent --always-approve stdio                                  # local
grok agent --always-approve serve --bind 127.0.0.1:2419 --secret X # WebSocket
```

**Stamp a `serve` process as the worker when you start it:**

```bash
SKILL_FORGE_AGENT_ROLE=worker grok agent --always-approve serve --bind 127.0.0.1:2419 --secret X
```

A per-job spawn gets its role marker from the dispatcher (see `external-worker-delegation`), but a
server starts once and serves every later session from that one environment. Launched from a shell
that declares you the orchestrator, it inherits *orchestrator* and every job it runs is told to
hand the work off — backwards. If the server exists to do delegated work, mark the whole server.

One server splitting both roles across its sessions has no per-session signal to carry this; use
separate servers, or `stdio`.

**Verified handshake** (probed against 0.2.102; the method still holds on 1.0.40, and on
1.0.46 `initialize` then `session/new` returned the session and its model list, though no
prompt was sent there. Re-probe the notification vocabulary before depending on a specific kind):

1. `initialize` -> `{"protocolVersion":1}`
2. `session/new` `{cwd, mcpServers:[], _meta:{yoloMode:true}}` -> `sessionId`
3. `session/prompt` `{sessionId, prompt:[{type:"text",text:"..."}]}` -> `{stopReason:"end_turn"}`
4. Agent pushes `session/update` notifications throughout.

A trivial one-tool prompt produced **104** `session/update` notifications. Observed
`sessionUpdate` kinds:

| Kind | Why it matters |
|------|----------------|
| `tool_call`, `tool_call_update`, `tool_call_delta_chunk` | live tool name, status, result — since 1.0 also available from headless `streaming-json` |
| `agent_thought_chunk`, `agent_message_chunk` | reasoning + response text |
| `pending_interaction`, `interaction_resolved` | the **permission back-channel** |
| `turn_completed`, `response_completed`, `session_summary_generated` | turn lifecycle |
| `available_commands_update`, `model_changed`, `session_info_update` | session state |

Side-channel notifications arrive as `_x.ai/*` methods (`_x.ai/session_notification`,
`_x.ai/queue/changed`, `_x.ai/models/update`, ...). **Note:** the docs spell these
`x.ai/*`; the wire uses a leading underscore. Discover from `initialize`, don't hardcode.

### What ACP still buys you

Tool visibility is no longer the reason — `streaming-json` has the same events since
1.0, and the old single-turn stop that made process lifecycle painful is gone
(Gotcha 1). What remains ACP-only:

- **The permission back-channel.** `pending_interaction` / `interaction_resolved` let
  your code answer a prompt mid-run instead of pre-approving everything with
  `--always-approve` or `--permission-mode auto`.
- **Mid-run steering.** Continuation is another `session/prompt` on the same session —
  no new process, no `-c`, no context reload — and you decide what to send based on
  what the last turn actually did.

**Choose:**

| Want | Use |
|------|-----|
| One batch job, minimal client code | `-p` (+ `--prompt-file`) with `streaming-json` |
| Granular permissions, mid-run steering | `agent stdio` (ACP) |
| Remote / multi-client | `agent serve` (WebSocket + `--secret`) |

Official ACP SDKs exist for TypeScript, Rust, Python, Go and Kotlin, and Zed / Neovim /
Emacs are working clients — prefer one over hand-rolling. `EXAMPLES.md` carries a
~40-line Python client that completes the handshake above.


## The brief

Grok starts **cold** — it cannot see the delegating conversation. Write a
self-contained `BRIEF.md` in the working directory and point Grok at it. Since 1.0
there is a flag for exactly this, so the brief need not be squeezed into an argument:

```bash
GROK_SUBAGENTS=0 grok --prompt-file BRIEF.md --no-subagents \
  --sandbox workspace --always-approve --output-format streaming-json
```

Two settings worth applying to a delegated spawn:

- **Subagents off: use `GROK_SUBAGENTS=0`, and probe that it worked.** The point is the
  no-recursion rule: the worker must not fan the brief out to children the orchestrator
  never sees. On 1.0.46 (2026-10-03) **`--no-subagents` was accepted but did not stop
  spawning in headless `-p`.** Asked to use `spawn_subagent`, a run with the flag, whether
  before or after the prompt, spawned a subagent that ran and returned its output, exactly
  as the run without it did. With `GROK_SUBAGENTS=0` in the environment the model searched
  for the tool, found none, and reported it unavailable. The flag's help text and the
  bundled docs both say it disables spawning, and "accepted" (verified on 1.0.40 and 1.0.41)
  was never evidence of "enforced". Keep the flag if you like, but do not rely on it, state
  the rule in the brief, and on any new version ask a worker to spawn a trivial subagent to
  see whether the control still holds. The `[subagents] enabled = false` config switch was
  not tested on 1.0.46; 1.0.41 changed which config tables disable subagents (one that only
  sets limits or models no longer does), so a setup that was quietly subagent-free may not
  be any more.
- **`--rules "<text>"`** appends to the system prompt. Useful for the role line, but it
  does **not** replace the brief's `Role` section: rules are tooling-injected and the
  brief is the authoritative channel (`external-worker-delegation` covers the precedence).

**Do not pass `--worktree` when the orchestrator already created one.** Grok has its
own worktree subsystem (`--worktree`, `--worktree-ref`, `grok worktree list|rm|gc`),
and pointing it at a dispatcher-managed checkout nests one isolation mechanism inside
another — two branches, two teardowns, and a merge target that is not the one the
orchestrator is reviewing. Pick whose worktree it is and say so in the brief.

Required sections:

1. **Facts** — what the product/system actually is; never assume shared context.
2. **Decisions already made** — as a table, marked do-not-relitigate, so it does not
   re-open settled questions.
3. **Environment** — Gotcha 2/3/4 constraints, what is pre-installed, what not to run.
4. **Deliverables** — concrete, with the code-vs-generate split spelled out.
5. **Honesty constraints** — what it must not claim or invent. Agents fill gaps with
   plausible fabrication (testimonials, metrics, unshipped features) unless forbidden.
6. **`NOTES.md` requirement** — decisions it made, departures from the brief and why,
   what it could not verify, what a human must do next. This is where the real
   signal lands; read it first when the run ends.

## Verify independently

Never accept the agent's completion claim. Re-run the gates yourself:

- Build/test commands, in your own shell (not the sandboxed one).
- `ffprobe` on media: codec, dimensions, frame rate, duration, size.
- Grep generated copy for fabrication — invented metrics, testimonials, claims about
  features that do not exist.
- Render the result and look at it.

Grok's `NOTES.md` departures are usually honest and sometimes better than the brief
(e.g. reusing production art instead of generating portraits). Read them, judge them
on merit, and record accepted departures upstream.

## Permission note

The host agent may be blocked from spawning an unattended `grok` process by its own
permission classifier, regardless of flags. That is a host-side control: explain what
you are trying to run and let the user launch it or add a permission rule. Do not
paper over it with flag variations.

## Anti-patterns

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| Treat exit 0 as success | Check artifacts; read `stopReason` and `num_turns` |
| Match `stopReason` against `EndTurn` | `end_turn` / `cancelled` — snake_case since 1.0 |
| Break the driver loop on any non-zero exit | `max_turns_reached` also exits non-zero; branch on `stopReason` |
| Raise `--max-turns` until it finishes | An unfinished brief at a high cap means the brief was too big |
| Reach for ACP to see tool calls | `streaming-json` has them since 1.0; use ACP for permissions and steering |
| Trust a wire-format claim from an older version — or from Grok's own README | `grok --version`, then probe; record both |
| Run npm's suggested `sudo chown -R ~/.npm` | It is npm misreading the sandbox boundary; nothing is root-owned |
| Assume a package manager still segfaults in-sandbox | Re-probe; pnpm 12.x relocates its store and installs fine |
| `--sandbox devbox` / no sandbox to dodge write errors | A custom profile with `read_write` for the cache path |
| Assume an unappliable sandbox degrades to unsandboxed | It refuses to start; probe the profile first |
| `--permission-mode auto` on a headless brief | `--always-approve` with the sandbox as the boundary; if you keep `auto`, scan for `Auto mode blocked` |
| Let Grok scaffold and install in-sandbox | Pre-build the environment outside it |
| Pass `--worktree` into a dispatcher-managed worktree | One isolation mechanism; decide whose and state it |
| Rely on `--no-subagents` for the no-recursion rule | `GROK_SUBAGENTS=0`, and probe that `spawn_subagent` is really gone; the flag was accepted but ineffective on 1.0.46 |
| Add `--permission-mode default` beside `--always-approve` | `--always-approve` alone; the combination cancelled the tool call on 1.0.46 and exited 0 having done nothing |
| Read the context window from the `end` event | `~/.grok/models_cache.json`, or ACP `session/new` metadata; the headless `end` event omits it |
| Scrape cost only from `run.jsonl` | `grok usage <sessionId>` persists it |
| `image_gen` a UI mockup or anything with real copy | Build it in code |
| Re-`image_gen` a recurring character | `image_edit` from one base image |
| Re-encode when joining shots | `-c copy` with matched res/fps |
| A prompt that references "the plan above" | Self-contained `BRIEF.md` via `--prompt-file` |
